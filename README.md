#What is a secret auction

The secret auction is also referred to as the silent auction. It is a gathering when items is on display for attendees to inspect, make offers on, and purchase.Â 

The name "silent auction" comes from the fact that, in contrast to typical auctions, there is no auctioneer present and participants submit their bids on a bid sheet anonymously and in silence using a bid number.

#How the code works.
The code allows the continuous input of each attendees with the inputed information made into a dictionary where the attendee name serves as the key and the bid as the value.

At the end of the event when there are no bidders left, the code runs to display the winner and the winning bid.

#Note
The main.py contains explaination on each line of code leading to the output.
